        <h1>About Me...</h1>
            <p>I come from what you would call a non-tech background.
    I have a bachelors degree in International Business and my MBA from Oral Roberts Univeristy.
    I have always had a fascination with computers and technology, so when life gave me lemons I decided to make lemonade. 
    Thus beginning my career change and decision to take a leap of faith to learn more about web and app development.</p>

        <h1>My Experience...</h1>
