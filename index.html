Experience
I have worked mainly in the service and education industry. 
- My first jobs were at restaurants where I gained skills like costumer service and multitasking.

and develop my skills.
- I also worked as interpreter and translator freelancer.
- I am currenlty working at a school where I also perform diferent tasks. I have worked as a secretary, teacher assitant and 
most currenlty as the Technology Director Assistant. I have gain many new skills in my current position. One of my favorites 
parts of my job is learning new things everyday. I also enjoy managing our school website, which by the way needs a lot of work.
