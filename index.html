            <h2><span>About</span></h2>
            <p>Hello, I am a very motivated 27 year old trying to break into a new industry. I currently work at labcorp as a Cytogentic Technoligist doing various wet lab 
                work. While working I realied that laboratory work was not for me. While putting client information into a computer I started thinking about the software that diagnositcs companies like Labcorp use, curoius as to how the work set out to 
                learn more about programming. I started with python and realized that I enjoyed doing the various code academy modules. Coding eventually developed into a something that I wanted to learn more about.
                I want to learn enough to be able to create and fix things. Hopefully all goes well in my journey </p>
