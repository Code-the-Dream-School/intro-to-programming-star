            <h2><span>About</span></h2>
            <p>Hello, I am a very motivated NC A&T Alumni trying to break into a new industry. I currently work at Labcorp as a Cytogentic Technologist doing various wet lab work. While I was studying for my Ctyogentics certification I learned of a branch of biology, called Bio-informatics, that makes use of technology to aid in biological research and discoveries. I became fascinated by it and started teaching myself how to code. I really enjoyed coding and it became a something I did just to pass the time by. Coding eventually developed into a something that I wanted to learn more about. Needing a more structured program I sought out the help of Code the dream, and was set down the right path. The first language I began learning was Python, then I switched to learning C++ because I really like the language. I took Code the Dreams intro Web Development class where I was the taught JavaScript,CSS,and HTML.</p>

            <h2><span>Experiences</span></h2>
            <p>I have a few months of experience when it comes to web development. Using my HTML,CSS,and JavaScript and problems solving skills I was able to create a matching game. I am currently learning SQL, C++, HTML,
            JavaScript and CSS, I dabbled a little bit in JAVA and Python. In the future I plan to get more involved in back end work. Future projects include creating an app from scratch, programming a microbit using python and C++. My interests are in Machine AI learning, game development, genome editing, and computational science.
