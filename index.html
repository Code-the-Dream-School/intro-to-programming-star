About
hello, I am 27 years old. I currently work at labcorp as a cytogentic technoligist. Wet lab 
work just isn't for me so I am trying to change my career. Coding was just kinda of a hobby that i started
then i grew to really enjoy it. 
Experience
I worked for several years as a veteriniary assistant. I was terrible at the job so I sought out lab work. I love looking 
at things under a micrscope. Miroscope organisims are so cool.
