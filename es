About

Hi, I'm Shondriane, a software engineer student with Code the Dream and I am
based in New York City. I recently graduated in 2020 from San Francisco State
University with a Bachelor of Science in Business Management and a minor in
Labor and Employment Relations. I love solving complex problems and looking
at ways to enhance users experiences. I am passionate about learning and 
spend most of my time developing new skillsets.
